<h1>App Development</h1>

<p>I have several years&rsquo; experience as an indie macOS developer, having designed, developed, and delivered the <a href="https://coherencelabs.com/typemetal/">TypeMetal</a> HTML + WordPress authoring app to the Mac App Store.  This has given me experience with App Store requirements, the submission/review process, and how to get things done from the outside.</p>

<h1>API Design and Implementation</h1>

<p>Our single most important task on the AppKit team was designing <em>clear, capable, extensible, and durable</em> APIs that boost app developers’ productivity. In my 16 years contributing to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/">AppKit</a>, I authored and circulated Objective-C and Swift API proposals designed in close adherence to key principles of clarity, consistency, and low-impedance interoperability that guided our endeabors — marshalling the results through discussion and iterative refinement to consensus. These proposals contributed additions and refinements to the public AppKit and SwiftUI APIs used by app developers, and adapted our Objective-C AppKit APIs to make them right at home in Swift’s new conventions. I implemented proposed AppKit enhancements while maintaining strong compatibility guarantees for existing apps, and managed gentle phase-out of deprecated APIs. Together with my team, I helped review proposals in other frameworks including UIKit and SwiftUI. Our process and guidelines influenced later efforts such as <a href="https://www.swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/">Swift’s API Design Guidelines</a>, bringing the same careful consistency to all Apple platforms.</p>

<h1>Human Interface Development (UX)</h1>

<p>In my time at Apple, I was fortunate to work closely with members of Apple&rsquo;s reknowned Human&nbsp;Interface (HI) team to prototype and refine changes through many major iterations of macOS’ look and feel. I contributed to design review discussions, offering feedback and helping bridge designs to engineering possibilities to realize designers’ intent for numerous new and updated UI features. I then worked across framework layers to implement each new look in my UI components. All of this flowed naturally from my earlier work in game development, where I worked closely with artists to realize desired results on Sony PlayStation hardware.</p>

<p>As a SpaceX engineer, I contributed to flight control software that <a href="https://youtu.be/_krgcofiM6M">flew</a> on the <a href="https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/starship/">Starship</a> project’s SuperHeavy booster on April 20, 2023. Working with an incredibly talented team, I asssited with sensor interfacing and Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC).</p>

<h1>OS Development</h1>

<p>I helped Apple ship 16 years of macOS releases. I contributed API design, new features, enhancements, and fixes to AppKit and macOS, frequently collaborating across system framework layers to achieve reaults. I helped internal and 3rd party app teams troubleshoot problems and reach solutions. I maintained binary compatibility for client apps, digging in and debugging when needed to solve issues in complex third party apps including Microsoft and Adobe titles. I generated new feature ideas that I prototyped, implemented, and presented.</p>

<h1>Presenting</h1>

<img src="/images/WWDC2019-CompositionalLayoutTalk-Troy.jpg">

<p>As an engineer on the AppKit team, I enjoyed the opportunity to present work at Apple&rsquo;s World Wide Developer Conference (WWDC), leveraging Apple-internal speaker training and content refinement support to give 12 talks over the years, to rooms of up to 3,000 attendees.  This most often involved designing the presentation from scratch and developing illustrative sample code, sometimes in collaboration with co-presenters.  I also designed and gave internal "SpotlightOn" talks for fellow Apple engineers.  I enjoy delivering quality content, motivating ideas clearly, and helping seed the spark that leads to new ideas, products, and enhancements.</p>
